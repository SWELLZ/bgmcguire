## Problem
This site was being built for commission for the company, BG McGuire Construction Co. It is a static page purely for information and a way to contact the business owner. The business owner hired me and he told me about how much he disliked his existing site. I noticed it was very dated so he hired me to re-design the site with a major focus on SEO and mobile responsiveness. I also focused a lot on performance because the area of his business is in an area with poor connection, I brought the performance score from 65 to 99 according to Lighthouse. If you take a look at his previous site you'll see why it needed to be upgraded:

![Old site 1](/resources/old-site-demo.png)

![Old site 2](/resources/old-site-demo2.png)

As you can see, he needed an upgrade:

![New Site 1](/resources/new-site-demo.png)

![New Site 2](/resources/new-site-demo2.png)

Another big problem was the fact that his old site wasn't mobile responsive... Now it is!
